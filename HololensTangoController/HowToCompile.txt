1. Compile server code

Compile the server/Hololens project with the code in HoloToolkit-Unity-master, run it 
on Hololens to build the server.

2. Switch from Windows Store build to Android build

Disable: HoloLensCamera, Managers, AnchorManager, and HologramCollection in the 
scene;

Delete folder HoloToolkit from Assets;

Delete GenericNetworkTransmitter.cs, SharedAnchorDebugText.cs, SharedCollection.cs,
and UNetAnchorManager.cs from HoloToolkit-Examples/SharingWithUNet/Scripts;

Download the latest Tango Unity SDK from: https://developers.google.com/tango/downloads;

Drag the SDK package to Assets to import it;

Ctrl+Shift+B -> Android -> Switch Platform;

Enable: Tango Manager, Tango Camera in the scene;

For Tango Manager, set: Auto-connect to Service, Enable Motion Tracking with Auto Rest, Enable

If Unity gives any error now, save, quit Unity, and start Unity again. The error should be gone 
after that;

Start the server Hololens first, then compile the project onto Tango. If everything goes well 
the Tango phone should work as a controller for Hololens.
