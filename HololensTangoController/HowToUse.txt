Once Hololens and Tango are connected, to reset the Controller, put the Tango phone
to the little white box in the Hololens view as close as possible, and double tap 
on Tango Phone when the position and rotation of Tango phone is pretty much the same 
as the white box. A yellow box will appear in the view, with the same position and 
rotation as the white box, and the position and rotation of the yellow box will follow 
the tango phone.

If later the user wants to reset the phone in the view, rotate/move the Hololens till
the white box is in a good position, and repeat the steps above.

I'll upload the Hololens+Tango Unity project here, and there will be a mannual 
of how to compile the project such that it works on both Tango and Hololens, and
some problems I encountered during the development.
